# Day 3 of Origin Code Academy:

## Change Calculator

Calculate the change for a given transaction and list out how much of each coin denomination is needed.

The technologies used were:
HTML
CSS (with Purecss.io)
Javascript (with Jquery)
Bower (to import Pure and Jquery)

Part of the solution was the suggested use of the modulo operator. It was tricky to figure out, but I eventually got an elegant way to do it with `%=` and cascading downwards by denomination.

Also: convert your currency to the smallest basic unit (cents) before working with it.
